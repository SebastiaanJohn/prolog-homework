% Basecase where Arg1 is an empty list.
sublist([], _).

/*
First seperate head H from Arg1.
Check if head H is a member of Arg2.
If true: Use built-in predicate select/3 to match head H with element H in Arg2, and
save remainder of list to variable Rem.
Insert tail T and list Rem into sublist and repeat until basecase.

%Question 2
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

% a)
% 'tic' is the principal functor and an prefix which is right-associative.
% 'tac' is the infix because it is in the middle.
:- op(300, fy, tic). 
:- op(200, fy, tac).

%Question 3
%++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

% a)
:- op(100, fx, the),
   op(100, fx, a),
   op(200, xfx, has).


% has(claudia,a(car)) = claudia has a car.
% 'has' is the principal functor.

% b)
/*
Prolog would reply:
Who = the lion,
What = hunger.
*/

% c)
/*
The query will cause a syntax error because the operator 'has' appears twice. 
This won't work because of the infix xfx. The 'x' suggests an argument whose precedence 
must be lower then that of the operator. A fix for this error would be to replace the 
last 'x' with an 'y': xfy.

The main two advantages with this version is the use of tail recursion,  
which means that the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function,
and that it saves the two previous fibonacci numbers. 
This will make sure that prolog doesn't run out of memory at very large numbers.
